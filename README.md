A simple board for connecting LEDs
==================================

### larsskj-003

This project is a simple board to connect LEDs - or virtually anything - to a flatcable. It's intended to be used with my other boards for model railway structures.

For more information, visit the [project homepage](https://larsskj.org/projects/larsskj-003).

The board is shared at [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/a2K9Nmxu), where you can order copies.
